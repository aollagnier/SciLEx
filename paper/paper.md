# Summary

SciLEx (Science Literature Exploration) is an open-source Python toolkit designed to support systematic literature reviews in research and academic contexts. Given one or two groups of keywords — which are combined with Boolean AND logic to form precise, compound queries — SciLEx concurrently collects papers from up to ten academic APIs: SemanticScholar, OpenAlex, IEEE, Arxiv, Springer, Elsevier, HAL, DBLP, Istex, and PubMed. The tool then deduplicates results across sources using DOI matching, URL matching, and fuzzy title comparison, ensuring that the same paper retrieved from multiple APIs is merged rather than counted multiple times. Beyond collection, SciLEx runs a configurable multi-stage filtering pipeline that scores papers on metadata completeness, enforces time-aware citation thresholds, and ranks results by a composite relevance score, reducing hundreds of thousands of raw results to a curated final set. It also extracts citation networks via OpenCitations[@peroni_opencitations_2020] and Semantic Scholar, and optionally enriches papers with Hugging Face metadata (linked models, datasets, and GitHub statistics), making it particularly useful for AI and machine learning literature reviews. Final outputs can be exported to BibTeX or pushed directly to a Zotero[@mueen_ahmed_zotero_2011] collection. All operations are idempotent: interrupted or repeated runs automatically skip already-completed queries, making SciLEx robust for use on standard personal hardware.

# Statement of need

Faced with the rapid growth in scientific publication volume [@10.1162/qss_a_00327], researchers initiating a new project or conducting a systematic review[@kitchenham2007guidelines] must survey a large and fragmented literature spread across disciplinary databases with incompatible formats and access policies. Existing reference managers such as Zotero provide manual search interfaces and import functionality, but do not automate multi-API retrieval, cross-source deduplication, or quality-based filtering. SciLEx fills this gap by providing a fully automated, configurable, and locally executable pipeline that takes keyword inputs and produces a ranked, deduplicated, and enriched bibliography — requiring no subscription and no cloud dependency. It is designed for researchers and graduate students who need to efficiently scope a new research area or assemble a reproducible literature corpus.

SciLEx enriches the resulting corpus through integration with external services such as [Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com) (available until May 2025 and now redirected to Hugging Face), Crossref [@hendricks_crossref_2020], and OpenCitations [@peroni_opencitations_2020]. Papers With Code was intended for the machine learning community and aimed at connecting research articles to their corresponding methods, implemented code, evaluation results on standard datasets, and initial paper annotations. OpenCitation enables the retrieval of citations and references for a given paper, which can be used both to filter papers by impact and to expand the corpus through citation snowballing.
Finally, SciLEx exports all gathered information into a Zotero collection, facilitating collaborative management, selection, and annotation of the corpus.

### Key Features
[SCHEMA]

- Multi-API collection with parallel processing (PubMed, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, IEEE Xplore, arXiv, Springer, HAL, DBLP, ISTEX)
- Complex query support: either (1) use a single list of keywords (one query per keyword), or (2) define two keyword lists that are combined pairwise, implicitly yielding queries that integrate both logical OR and logical AND operators.
- Smart deduplication using DOI and title matching
- Citation network extraction via OpenCitations + Semantic Scholar with SQLite caching
- Quality filtering pipeline integrating:
   * time-aware citation thresholds
   * relevance ranking (based on keywords list and potential additional "bonus keywords")
   * itemType filtering
- Hugging Face enrichment (NEW): Extract ML models, datasets, GitHub stats, and AI keywords
- Bulk Zotero upload in batches of 50 items
- Idempotent collections for safe re-runs (automatically skips completed queries)
- BibTeX extraction

# Software design

SciLEx is mainly based on a pipeline approach: 
API Collection → Deduplication → ItemType Filter → Keyword Filter → Quality Filter → Citation Filter → Relevance Ranking → Output

1. Collection system: To support an ever-growing number of digital APIs, the library is based on an abstract collector interface class that defines the specifics of each API collector.
2. Aggregation Pipeline: **?????????**
3. Format Converters: All collected metadata are then converted into a unified structure.
4. Citation extractors: **?????????**

SciLEx also relies on two configuration files that must be filled by the user:
1. the first one gathers all the API key required to run a search
2. the second one allows to **?????????**

**LE PARAGRAPHE SUIVANT ARRIVE SANS LIEN AVEC CE QUE PRECEDE**

SciLEx is a Python‑based tool designed to search, retrieve, and analyze scientific papers using a structured, object‑oriented approach. The primary class, PaperRetriever, serves as the central interface and can be used both via the command line and as an importable module for integration into custom Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks. Supporting classes—PubMedSearcher, ImageExtractor, PaperTracker, and ReferenceRetriever—extend its capabilities, allowing for enhanced paper searching, citation tracking, and figure extraction.

# Comparison with existing software

**1. CoLRev (2026)**
A large project with broader goals than SciLEx

**2.PyPaperRetriever (2025)**
PyPaperRetriever [@Turner2025] is a medical research‑oriented literature exploration tool. It first relies on a set of papers identified by a DOI or PubMed ID and queries three different APIs (Unpaywall, NIH's Entrez, and Crossref) to retrieve related papers based on the citation network induced by the input articles. The software also supports extraction of PDF content from the resulting articles, which makes it more suitable for conducting text mining. Its digital library coverage is lower than that of SciLEx, which is more general, and its extraction results are more focused on the textual content of similar retrieved articles than on their bibliographic data.

**3. Pygetpapers (2022)** 
PygetPapers [@Garg2022] is also a tool for medical and biology research which helps to collect papers based on a simple list of keywords by requesting several digital libraries (arXiv, EuropePMC, bioRxiv, medRxiv). This software does not provide filtering strategies to handle the large number of papers returned by the APIs it uses, and it does not implement deduplication strategies. Moreover, the outputs of Pygetpapers are not organized into a bibliography that can be easily shared (e.g., as PDF or XML files). This software also serves a different purpose than SciLEx, notably by being more centred on text-mining.

 **4. PyPaperBot (2020)**

PyPaperBot [@pypaperbot], while functional, has significant limitations that prompted the development of PyPaperRetriever. PyPaperBot relies primarily on Sci‑Hub, which is ethically controversial, may be unlawful to use in many jurisdictions, and is often blocked by academic institutions and in certain countries. Additionally, it lacks support for PubMed ID‑based searches, a critical feature for researchers in biomedical sciences.
